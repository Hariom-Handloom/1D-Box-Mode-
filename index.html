    <h1>1D-Box Model</h1>
    <img src="images.png" alt="1d box image" />
    <h2>1D Box Model (Particle in a Box)</h2>
    <p>
      The 1D box model in quantum mechanics describes a particle (such as an
      electron) confined within a rigid, one-dimensional box of length (𝐿). The
      box has impenetrable walls, meaning the particle cannot exist outside it.
      This model provides insights into energy quantization and wavefunctions in
      confined systems.
    </p>

    <h2>Assumptions of the Model</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>The particle is free to move within the box along one dimension.</li>
      <li>
        The potential energy inside the box is V(x)=0, and it is infinite
        (V(x)=∞) outside the box.
      </li>
      <li>
        The particle cannot escape the box, leading to boundary conditions at
        x=0 and x=L.
      </li>
      <li>
        The particle exhibits wave-like behavior governed by the Schrödinger
        equation.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Schrödinger Equation</h2>
    <p>The time-independent Schrödinger equation for a particle is:</p>
    <p class="equation">
      -ħ<sup>2</sup>/2m (d<sup>2</sup>ψ(x)/dx<sup>2</sup>) + V(x)ψ(x) = Eψ(x)
    </p>
    <p>Inside the 1D box where \( V(x) = 0 \), the equation simplifies to:</p>
    <p class="equation">
      d<sup>2</sup>ψ(x)/dx<sup>2</sup> + k<sup>2</sup>ψ(x) = 0
    </p>

    <h2>General Solution</h2>
    <p>
        Inside a one-dimensional box where the potential energy \( V(x) = 0 \), the Schrödinger equation simplifies to:
    </p>
    <p class="equation">
        d<sup>2</sup>ψ(x)/dx<sup>2</sup> + k<sup>2</sup>ψ(x) = 0
    </p>
    <p>
        The general solution of this second-order differential equation is:
    </p>
    <p class="equation">
        ψ(x) = A sin(kx) + B cos(kx)
    </p>
    <p>
        Here, \( A \) and \( B \) are constants to be determined using boundary conditions, and \( k \) is related to the energy \( E \) by:
    </p>
    <p class="equation">
        k = √(2mE)/ħ
    </p>

    <h2>Boundary Conditions</h2>
    <p>
        For a particle in a 1D box of length \( L \), the boundary conditions are:
    </p>
    <div class="important">
        ψ(0) = 0 and ψ(L) = 0
    </div>
    <p>
        Applying these conditions to the general solution:
    </p>
    <p class="equation">
        ψ(0) = A sin(0) + B cos(0) = B = 0
    </p>
    <p>
        This means the solution simplifies to:
    </p>
    <p class="equation">
        ψ(x) = A sin(kx)
    </p>
    <p>
        Applying the second boundary condition \( ψ(L) = 0 \):
    </p>
    <p class="equation">
        ψ(L) = A sin(kL) = 0
    </p>
    <p>
        For \( A \neq 0 \), we must have \( sin(kL) = 0 \), which gives:
    </p>
    <p class="equation">
        kL = nπ, where n = 1, 2, 3, ...
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore:
    </p>
    <p class="equation">
        k = nπ/L
    </p>

    <h2>Quantized Energy Levels</h2>
    <p>
        Using the relation \( k = √(2mE)/ħ \) and substituting \( k = nπ/L \), the quantized energy levels of the particle are:
    </p>
    <p class="equation">
        E<sub>n</sub> = (n²π²ħ²) / (2mL²), where n = 1, 2, 3, ...
    </p>
    <p>
        The quantum number \( n \) represents the energy level of the particle, and the lowest energy level corresponds to \( n = 1 \).
    </p>

    <h2>Normalized Wavefunction</h2>
    <p>
        The normalized wavefunction \( ψ<sub>n</sub>(x) \) for the particle is:
    </p>
    <p class="equation">
        ψ<sub>n</sub>(x) = √(2/L) sin(nπx/L), where n = 1, 2, 3, ...
    </p>
    <p>
        The normalization ensures that the total probability of finding the particle inside the box is 1.
